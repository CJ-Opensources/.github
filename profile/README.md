## WELCOME TO CJ OPEN SOURCES  👋

The purpose of this organization is to bring together developers who are passionate about building open source software. We will work on a variety of projects, from small personal projects to large collaborative efforts. We are looking for members who are skilled in a variety of programming languages and technologies, and who are willing to collaborate and share their knowledge. We believe that open source software is the future of software development, and we are excited to be a part of it.<br>
